^ The above link is a rough design that I made for this project.

It is important to note that I am treating my /user1.html (Aidan's Page) page as the home page for now, as I am still unsure where exactly this app will take me. So all of my css so far has been for my user1 page, and I will work to ensure that the styling works for other pages as well.

I am a little behind, and as of right now I am working on:
* adding the icons
* creating design tokens/factoring out css reset
* refactoring the html and css for clarity and readability
  - refactoring certain css styles into their own files
