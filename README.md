## assignment 3 | typescript and lit components
as of right now I have completed the first three tasks of this assignment. 
* Part1: I didn't add a user-panel component for part 1; i don't know if that is required or a suggestion, but I can add it if needed.
* Part2: I added a dark/light mode toggle switch - I need to adjust the styling of the dropdown and this switch a little bit.
* Part3: I created a 'general-list' component and I pass in data for the text within each card and for the name of the component (from the HTML). So, I was able to repurpose this component to work for the friends list, games list, and playlist list. Below is a sketch of this component design. I also included a sketch with a possible future plan for implementing more components. I may create a card/cards components so that I can repurpose the general-list component, and compose it with different card types depending on the need; for example, I will need a different card type for the 'favorites list', and I don't want to create a specific list component just for this section of the website.

^ The above link is a rough design that I made for this project, for the user page, and then I freestyled the designs for the other pages, but I will go back and ensure all margins, padding, font-weight, font-sizing is consistent across all pages.
