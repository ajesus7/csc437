## assignment 3 | typescript and lit components
all four parts complete now; I allow the user to sort the first three lists (I haven't created a component for the favorites list yet) by their names in alphabetical order.
* so, if you are sorting the friends list, a name with the letter A will come first. The user can then revert the list to its original order by clicking the toggle switch again.
* I did not provide the user the option to sort in reverse alphabetical, because I felt that I usually don't use that feature, but may implement in the future.

On another note, I created the toggle switch component to be used within the sortable list component; the toggle switch component is tightly coupled with the sortable list component, but I
think it would be cool to adjust the toggle switch component in the future so that I can pass in information to it, and it can be reused for other components. This would mean passing in the text that goes in the label, as well as passing in the property that the toggle switch is tracking/updating.

The links to each friend's profile/game/playlist should be functional when connected to the database, but for now they are just placeholders.

## assignment 2 | css/styling update

^ The above link is a rough design that I made for this project, for the user page, and then I freestyled the designs for the other pages, but I will go back and ensure all margins, padding, font-weight, font-sizing is consistent across all pages.
